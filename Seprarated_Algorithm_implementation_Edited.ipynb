    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to the core algorithms implemented for this project, with a specific focus on unit testing. Each section presents a self-contained algorithm, including its purpose, detailed code implementation, and a clear demonstration of its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this document is to ensure the technical integrity of the codebase. By isolating and testing each function, we can verify that the data generation, preference modeling, voting rules (Plurality, Veto, and Borda), and distortion calculations are all working as intended. This process is crucial for establishing a reliable foundation before moving on to larger-scale integration tests and the final experimental runs."
